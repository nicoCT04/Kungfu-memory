# Kung Fu Panda Memory Game by NicoCT04

## Description

This project is a memory game inspired by *Kung Fu Panda*. The goal of the game is to match all the cards in the fewest moves possible. The game is developed in **React** and uses a single HTML file with Babel to compile JSX directly in the browser.
